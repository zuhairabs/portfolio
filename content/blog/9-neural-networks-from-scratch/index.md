If you're willing to understand how neural networks work behind the scene and debug the back-propagation algorithm step by step by yourself, these slides should be a good starting point. <br> We will cover deep learning popular applications, the concept of the artificial neuron and how it relates to the biological one, the perceptron and the multi-layer one. We'll also dive in activation functions, loss functions and **formalize the training of a neural net via the back-propagation algorithm.** <br> In the last part, you'll learn how to code a fully functioning trainable neural network from scratch. In pure python code only, with no frameworks involved. 

All the code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/ahmedbesbes/Neural-Network-from-scratch">github repo</a>.
