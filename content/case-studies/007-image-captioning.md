title: Image Captioning
excerpt: How to translate an image to text with the ability to interpret what the machine learning algorithm sees? This is possible using neural networks and specifically encoder-decoders with attention mechanisms.

## How it works

This is a web demo that allows to perform image captioning with visual attention mechanism to highlight the areas of the image where the model look when generating a token.

The model implementation is in PyTorch and based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) called: "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention"

## Code 
 
Coming soon.
